Requirements
===============

The following requirements must be met for a smooth operation of the extension.

|mage1|
---------------------

The following |mage1| versions are supported:

- Community Edition (Open Source) 1.9.x

PHP
---------------------

These PHP versions are supported by the extension:

- PHP 5.4+
- PHP 7.0+

Further information can also be found in these files inside the extension package / repository:

* README.md
* composer.json

If in doubt: the version information in the file *composer.json* supersedes any
other information.

Browser support
---------------------

The extension supports common browsers in their latest versions. It might also work in older browser
versions, however this is not guaranteed.

The extension uses native *datalist* attributes to display address suggestions in the shop frontend.
For browsers that don't support this, an alternative solution has been implemented.

The functionality in the shop frontend has been tested in the following desktop browsers:

* Chrome 69
* Firefox 62
* Edge 42
* IE 11
* Safari 11
* Opera 56

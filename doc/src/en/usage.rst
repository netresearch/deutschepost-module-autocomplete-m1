Module usage
===============================

Checkout order
-------------------------------

In the checkout, billing and shipping addresses can be completed automatically.

These input fields are auto-completed by the |modulename| module:

* Street 1
* Postal code (ZIP)
* City

As soon as sufficient data has been entered into one of the above fields, suggestions will be
displayed from which the customer can chosse. The other fields will then be filled in automatically (as far
as possible).

The country must be set to Germany before entering data into the above fields. Otherwise, no
auto-completion will happen. See also the notes about `Supported countries`_.
